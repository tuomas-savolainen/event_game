event_game
==========

Event based game I wrote to learn Ruby

The main goal of this project is to write a generic event based library for my own use.
The implemented game is still quite simple, but it demonstrates how you could write a event based game.

I basically wrote this with only ruby's documentation and I haven't done much event based programming before (aside from some simple GUI stuff), so
please if you think that something could be more simply or cleverly implemented, please do comment.
